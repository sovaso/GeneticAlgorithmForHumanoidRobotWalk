# GeneticAlgorithmForHumanoidRobotWalk
Projects that combines both TRPO algorithm and genetic algorithm in order to find optimized hyperparameters for the TRPO algorithm
This project is used for Master Thesis purposes on Faculty of Technical Sciences, Novi Sad 2021.

## How to run TRPO algorithm
Navigate to the `GeneticAlgorithmForHumanoidRobotWalk/code` and then run `python main_train_trpo.py` in terminal

## How to run genetic algorithm
Navigate to the `GeneticAlgorithmForHumanoidRobotWalk/code` and then run `python main_train_ga.py` in terminal
